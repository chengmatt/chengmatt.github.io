In particular, part of my dissertation focuses on advancing the federal sablefish stock assessment, where I am developing models to characterize trends in abundance using fishery-dependent data. Additionally, I am evaluating optimal treatments of fleet structure within the sablefish stock assessment, given rapid shifts in fishery structure. Other areas of my research using using simulation analyses to determine best practices for stock assessments."
