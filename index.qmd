I am a 3rd year PhD student in the College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences program at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, based in Juneau. 


Currently, my research focuses on advancing and developing stock assessment methods. In particular, part of my dissertation focuses on advancing the federal sablefish stock assessment, where I am developing models to characterize trends in abundance using fishery-dependent data. Additionally, I am evaluating optimal treatments of fleet structure within the sablefish stock assessment, given rapid shifts in fishery structure. Other areas of my research using using simulation analyses to determine best practices for stock assessments.
